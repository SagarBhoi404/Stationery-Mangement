# Stationery Management System Using Java



We developed this software for College Stationery Management. In this
software we will first store the data of the students and then while
distributing the stationery just enter the enrollment number and the student
details and related topics will be automatically fetched and then the manuals,
Files, uniforms can be given to students and after insertion, a printout of the
receipt of the stationery will be generated. All the data will be stored in the
database and it can also be printed.
